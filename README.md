## Predicting 2025 and 2028 dNBR and dNDIV for Csarf Smith River Complex / Evaluating the Effects of 2019 California Wildfire Fund

  Biodiverse regions across California remain vulnerable to harmful wildfires year round. Quantifying and
measuring these regionsâ€™ wildfire resilience is necessary for understanding where/how to allocate
environmental resources. Several ecological wildfire studies have been conducted utilizing artificial
intelligence and remote sensing to analyze and predict biodiversity damage across wildfire prone regions,
including Northern Algeria and Arkansas, USA. The current case study aims to analyze biodiversity
damage from the 2023 Csarf Smith River Complex Fire in Six Rivers National Forest, California and
predict the difference in Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and difference in Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (dNDVI) for 2025 and 2028 using remote-sensing-based random forest (RF) regression.
Furthermore, to observe, holistically, a practical method California has implemented to address state-wide
wildfire damage, the 2019 California Wildfire Fund (AB 1054 and AB 111) was evaluated using the
synthetic control method (SCM). For this case study, remote sensing data from the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA (Landsat 9 Satellite C2 L2, TerraClimate and the Land Data
Assimilation System) were utilized for processing relevant spectral indexes for the RF. Data from NOAA,
Energy Information Agency, International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis were
utilized as synthetic control datasets to evaluate the effects of the 2019 California Wildfire Fund. Elevated
topography in this study area is susceptible to high severity burn effects, while less elevated topography
burns less. This result affected dNBR and dNDVI predictions as elevated areas seemingly did not have
strong resilience to rampant burns. This demonstrates a direct correlation to potential lower transpiration
rates for elevated areas, warranting further analysis. Results of low variance, post-treatment, between the
treated unit and the synthetic control unit, poses concern for the positive effect of the 2019 Wildfire Fund.
